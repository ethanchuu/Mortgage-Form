# Mortgage Backed Securities Application

## Completed Project Components
- [x] Backend Command Line Interface
- [x] Mortgage Filtering
- [x] Rate Calculation
- [x] Mortgage Securitization
- [x] Extra Credit: All 7 Filter Types
- [x] Extra Credit: Serializable Transactions
- [x] Extra Credit: Add New Mortgage
- [x] Frontend Application

### Extra Credit Attempted and Completed
- Implemented all 7 filter types (MSAMD, Income-to-debt ratio, County, Loan Type, Tract-to-MSAMD Income, Loan Purpose, Property Type)
- Added Serializable Transaction handling
- Developed functionality to add new mortgages
- Created a full-featured web frontend

## Known Issues
The backend application experienced difficulties connecting to the PostgreSQL database. This stemmed from:

Incorrect Database Credentials: The username, password, database URL, or port configured in the application properties did not match the database settings.
JDBC Driver Issues: The PostgreSQL JDBC driver was not working and configuring with the part 1 database

There were inconsistencies between the data types used in the backend code and the actual database schema. Examples of this issue could include:

Mapping a VARCHAR column to an Integer in the code.
Using a DATE type in the database but handling it as a String in the backend.
Precision mismatches in DECIMAL or FLOAT fields.

CORS Restrictions: The backend server did not allow requests from the frontendâ€™s origin.
API Endpoint Mismatches: The frontend did not react to the routes and endpoints
Server Not Running: The backend server did properly start or reachable at the expected URL.
